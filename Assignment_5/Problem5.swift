//Define a struct classed Student. Each student is defined by the following attributes:
//o firstName
//o lastName
//o address
//o Year of birth
//o gpa
//- Define a class called Classroom with an instance property which is an array of Students.
//- Define a static method called printStudent for the struct Student to print the studentâ€™s
//information (firstName, lastName, address, year of birth and gpa)
//- Define an instance method for the class Classroom, called generateList. This method
//create 10 instances of the class students with some arbitrary information and add them to
//the list of students.
//- Define an instance method for the class Classroom, called getHighestGpa. This methods
//will search into the array of Students and returns the student with the highest GPA. The
//method also prints the information of the student with the highest GPA.
